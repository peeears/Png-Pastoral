            This site is a png Pastoral generator which combing skys and landscapes into frames when
            refreshing.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs (portable-network-images) are anonymous, circulated, public, generic.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are contradictory, they appear to be a public resource. But the watermarks implies that they are
            mastered, preventing you from getting a “perfect” image.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are a fiction, even the transparent grid in the background of the image is just a symbol and imitation
            of
            transparency.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are advertised as free, personal, capable, beautiful, all of these are idealized description.
            </br>
            </br>
            At the same time they are not perfect, they are a mass-produced replica, they are constrained by pixels,
            reflecting the
            grids of different sizes.
            </br>
            </br>
            The same as Pastoral/Idyllic, which seems to be a peek at utopia under the gaze of the city, a symbol of
            perfect
            fantasy. The default image of the computer and mobile phone is always a variety of landscape scenery, the
            most typical
            is the Window XP desktop background.
            </br>
            </br>
            By referencing the Adobe's interpretation of png file, and the icon used to symbolize images. Four elements
            - sky,
            landscape, frame and the grey pixel grids, are used to represent the image.
            </br>
            </br>
            Picture frames are decorations added onto the wall, while in the context of screens, they are more closer to
            wallpaper:
            a surface that is added to the surface, and at the same time they are the background. On the computer
            display interface,
            the file is like a picture frame on the wall. The screen is like a picture frame, carrying the beautiful
            scenery and a
            dream of escaping the busy city life and going to the peaceful countryside.
            </br>
            </br>
            By the recombining variations, the image sometimes appears within the frame, sometimes inside the image,
            sometimes
            attached to the image, and sometimes free from the image. Hope all these images and languages being used to
            describe the
            file is forming a poem, a eclogue, a gallery.</div>
