            This site is a png Pastoral generator combing skys and landscapes into frames when
            refreshing.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs (portable-network-images) are anonymous, circulated, public, and generic.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are contradictory. They appear to be a public resource, but the watermarks prevent you from getting a
            “perfect” image.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are a fiction. Even the transparent grid in the background of the image is just a symbol and imitation
            of transparency.
            </br>
            </br>
            Pngs are advertised as a free, personal, capable, and beautiful item. All of these are idealized
            description.
            </br>
            </br>
            At the same time they are not perfect. They are a mass-produced replica. They are constrained by pixels,
            and the grids show different sizes.
            </br>
            </br>
            Same as Pastoral/Idyllic, a peek at utopia under the gaze of the city, a symbol of
            perfect fantasy. The default image background of the computer and mobile phone is always a variety of
            landscape scenery (e.g. Window XP desktop).
            </br>
            </br>
            Four iconic elements
            - sky, landscape, frame, and the grey pixel grids are used to represent the image.
            </br>
            </br>
            Picture frames are decorations added onto the wall, while in the context of screens, they are more closer to
            wallpaper:
            a surface that is added to the surface, and at the same time they are the background. On the computer
            display interface,
            the file is like a picture frame on the wall. The screen is like a picture frame, carrying the beautiful
            scenery and a
            dream of escaping the busy city life and going to the peaceful countryside.
            </br>
            </br>
            A series of combination generated sometimes appears within the frame, sometimes inside the image,
            sometimes attached to the image, and sometimes free from the image. Overall is forming a poem, a eclogue, a
            gallery.
